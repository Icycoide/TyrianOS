                            Dear TyrianOS users, <br><br>
                            There is currently an issue with the latest build of TyrianOS which does not properly mark the disk image as ISOHYBRID, causing some issues booting. <br><br>

                            For a temporary workaround, format your USB as FAT32 and MBR, and copy the contents of the ISO to it. Your machine will automatically detect the bootx64.efi file included on the disk. <br><br>

                            While it might help to get it booting, on behalf of the Fedora project and their many SIG's, we would like to announce you should NEVER use Ventoy to boot any Fedora related distros as it's LVM emulation system is a major point of failure which causes many things to break, and allows malware such as rootkits to easy inject itself into the boot process and go undetected. <br><br>

                            Sorry for this inconvenience. <br><br>
                            In fact, as of Fedora 40, Ventoy booting is unsupported and we stopped helping people who booted and installed using it <br><br>
                            
                            Using DD and derived USB creators such as Etcher are NOT supported. (Specifically for TyrianOS though, not Fedora.)<br><br>

                    <h1>Why TyrianOS?</h1>
                    <p>
                        TyrianOS is an immutable operating system based on <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/">Fedora Kinoite</a>, using <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">KDE Plasma</a> as the desktop environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means that TyrianOS provides a safe and reliable experience, with very low risk of breaking
                        your system.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card" style="background-color: #29292b; padding: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                <div>
                    <h1>What does TyrianOS do differently from Kinoite?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Great question! First of all, TyrianOS uses the <b>ublue</b> version of Kinoite, which offers additional optimisation.
                        We also include the <b><a href="https://terra.fyralabs.com/">Terra</a></b> repository for anyone who prefers to install a wider range of packages in the <b>Toolbx</b> container.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also include a customised, more complete KDE Plasma environment than Kinoite, since we install the @kde-desktop group, making sure that nothing is left behind.
                    </p>
